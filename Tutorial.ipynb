    "## 1️⃣ Introduction and Motivation\n",
    "- Cold atom images often contain interference fringes caused by imperfections in the imaging system or environmental noise.\n",
    "- These fringes reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and complicate quantitative analysis of atom distributions.\n",
    "- Fringe removal is therefore critical for accurate measurement of physical parameters in cold atom experiments.\n",
    "- This application uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to detect and subtract fringe patterns while preserving the atomic density information."

    "## 2️⃣ Mathematical Background: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that identifies the directions (principal components) along which the variance of the data is maximized. It is widely used for noise reduction and pattern extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PCA Formulation\n",
    "Given a data matrix $X$ with $n$ samples (rows) and $p$ features (columns), PCA finds orthogonal vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\arg\\max_{||v||=1} \\text{Var}(Xv) $$\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\arg\\max_{||v||=1, v \\perp v_1} \\text{Var}(Xv) $$\n",
    "and so on, for $i = 1, ..., p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{n-1} X^T X$, and the corresponding eigenvalues indicate the variance captured by each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying PCA to Fringe Removal\n",
    "- Each column of the atom image is considered a vector.\n",
    "- The corresponding reference image column represents the background pattern.\n",
    "- PCA identifies the dominant patterns in the reference image (typically the fringes).\n",
    "- These patterns are projected onto the atom image and subtracted, effectively removing the fringe component while keeping the underlying atomic distribution.\n",
    "- Columns with too few pixels are skipped to avoid computational errors (PCA requires more than 1 sample)."

    "- `inverse_transform()` reconstructs the pattern in the original feature space.\n",
    "- Subtracting the reconstruction removes fringes from the atom image.\n",
